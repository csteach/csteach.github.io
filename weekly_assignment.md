#### Week 3 - 29th January 2015
1. Please prepare for a quiz at the start of next week's class. This quiz will include the following:
    * material covered within the class [notes](notes), weeks 1 to 3, and material discussed in class
    * multiple choice questions

#### Week 2 - 22nd January 2015
* Review this week's [notes and material](/notes), which includes the class notes
* Please select two digital products that you like, and two that you dislike.
  * consider their user interfaces and general design
    * why do you like or dislike these products?
    * what would you like to change?
    * are there features or aspects of similar products that could be incorporated within these products?
    * what is the design and development history for your chosen products?
      * ie: can you trace a series of design compromises and improvements in previous models up to the current product release?
      
An example of the above might be the design and development of the user interface for the Apple iPod, iPad, or iPhone. 

This product review provides an initial opportunity to consider products and designs for your final course assessment.

I shall be creating a [Trello](https://trello.com/comp388441luc) board for this work. Please [contact me](mailto:nhayward@luc.edu?subject=Trello) 
by the end of Monday 26th January 2015 with your [Trello](https://trello.com/) username. If you are new to [Trello](https://trello.com/), 
you will need to register for their service. 

After receiving your Trello username, I will add you to the class organisation. Please post your product ideas, both 
good and bad, to the [Product Brainstorming](https://trello.com/comp388441luc) board by the end of Wednesday 28th January 2015.

This Trello organisation is private, and only visible to those enrolled in this course. 

We will discuss these products during next week's class.
